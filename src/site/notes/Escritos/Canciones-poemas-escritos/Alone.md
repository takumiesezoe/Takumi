Alone, just me and my selfishness  
Alone, feeling this emptiness  
Cursed by thoughts I can't confess,  
Drowning slow in my own mess.

I reach for warmth, but push away,  
Sabotage love, then beg it to stay.  
I crave the light, yet shut my eyes,  
Afraid of truth, addicted to lies.

A war inside I cannot name,  
Longing for peace, but feeding the flame.  
Tired of the mirror, tired of this face,  
Tired of running in the same dark place.
