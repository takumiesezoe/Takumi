In my mind there are no pictures,

no faces waiting for me

behind my closed eyelids.

Dreams arrive as whispers,

not paintings—

as if the canvas of my skull

is forever primed,

yet untouched.

I know the word sunrise,

but not the private dawn

others carry in their chests.

When you say “green meadow,”

I hear wind in the syllables,

but I cannot walk through it—

only feel the grammar

of grass.

Still, I am not empty.

My world blooms

in sound, in thought,

in the thrum of meanings

strung like quiet beads.

I do not see your face—

but I hold

your presence.
