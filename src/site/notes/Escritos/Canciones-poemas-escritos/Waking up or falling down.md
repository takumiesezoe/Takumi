[Intro – Soft](Whispering in the background) Today I asked ChatGPT if one can survive A deep cut to the neck.(Soft atmosphere, gentle guitar, melancholic voice) If this is a dream, why does it hurt so much? Why does the light fade when I try to get up? Maybe it's just a nightmare I have to face, And when I wake up, will I still see your face?  
[Verse 1 – Soft](Clean guitar, soft bass) I watch the time slip through my hands, The grey surrounds me, fear expands. Is this abyss my fault alone? Or just my mind breaking down on its own?  
[Pre-Chorus – Building Up] (Repeated)(Rhythm starts to rise, guitars becoming more present) It’s not enough! I am nothing, that I know, Yet here I stand, lost in the flow. I drown myself in empty space, Why do I crawl? Why do I stay?  
[Chorus – Strong](Drums and distorted guitars, powerful vocals) Spinning down the void, trying to escape, My reflection in the glass has nothing to say. Is this fear real, or just my mind’s decay? To live or to die—what’s the worst fate?  
[Verse 2 – Soft](Soft guitars return, light synths in the background) I hear sirens, yet I feel so numb, Like a distant echo, like a soul undone. Who holds control of this broken life? I crawl, but still can’t find the light.  
[Pre-Chorus – Building Again](More intensity in drums, leading into the chorus) I don’t know what I am, what I do, Yet here I stand, lost and confused. Between shadows, between silent screams, I drift away in this sea of dreams.  
[Chorus – Strong](Explosive energy, full emotion in the vocals) Spinning down the void, trying to escape, My reflection in the glass has nothing to say. Is this fear real, or just my mind’s decay? To live or to die—what’s the worst fate?  
[Bridge – Intense & Emotional](Heavy guitars, voice filled with tension) I am the tumor, the mistake that lingers, Blood on my hands, life crushed between fingers. Am I the villain or am I the prey? Yet here I stay, fading away.  
[Bridge – In Honor of Bella](Soft and sorrowful, acoustic or clean guitar) Bella is gone, so young, so far, And I am left with this guilt in my heart. Why didn’t I see, why didn’t I hear? Now there’s just emptiness, silent and clear.Every day I wonder if I could have done more, If I had been there, would she have walked out that door? But silence took her, wrapped her in pain, And I am still here, lost in the rain.(Guitars begin to rise slightly, leading into the final chorus) Bella, my friend, how could I forget? Your name drowns in this abyss I cannot cross. Now I carry you, a shadow in my chest, And in every tear, I still search for your rest.  
[Outro – Soft, Melancholic](Everything fades out slowly, leaving a ghostly atmosphere) Maybe this is just a dream that fades, And when I wake, maybe there’ll be nothing left. But still, I stay, searching for that light, Where at last, I may rest tonight.
