I am disposable  
I could be trown on the bin  
Everyone knew I wasn't able  
They knew I'd be cosumed by the sin  
I am a shadow dressed in skin  
Something irreversible  
I wished I was clean  
But I'm dirty , horrible  
I am waste , I am disposable  
I wish I was more but I can't  
Even though I am usable  
They can use me as they want

I am waste, I am disposable,

Thrown away, replaceable.

I wish I meant more than I do,

But I’m just a tool they’re passing through.  
Even if I begged to feel,

They’d remind me none of this is real.

I’m the echo no one hears,

Built from silence, soaked in fears.

Can someone see the soul I lost?Can someone count how much it cost?

To be alive but feel so numb,

To pray for night when morning comes…
