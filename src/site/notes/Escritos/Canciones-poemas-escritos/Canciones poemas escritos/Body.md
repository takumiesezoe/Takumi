My flesh isn't mine

So i don't know why

I care about my looks

My horrible body

My arms , my forehead

My thighs ,my belly and

I feel so bad,in my body

I don't want anyone to look

I feel dirty , full of fat

Every thing that goes inside

Must get outside

I don't like it , it makes me feel bad
