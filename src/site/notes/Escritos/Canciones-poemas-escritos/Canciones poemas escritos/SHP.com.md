I take refuge in the images,  
scars that aren’t mine,  
but they bleed like they're my own  
in these endless, silent nights.

  

Their sick light pulls me in,  
like a lighthouse to a wreck,  
shattered faces, opened skin —  
a language etched in flesh.

  

I don’t know if I seek help  
or just want to fall deeper,  
collecting broken echoes  
like they'd make me feel cleaner.

  

Each photo is a trigger,  
a bullet straight to thought,  
proof that pain has a body,  
and it can be caught and shot.

  

But this is not art — it’s rot,  
it's a chain, a slow collapse,  
it’s diving into darkness  
and digging through the cracks.

  

And though I know it kills me,  
though it burns and poisons slow,  
I go back, like a stray dog  
licking wounds it won’t let go.
