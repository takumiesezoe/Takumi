My dream is to be rich and be succesful I know they don't have both to complementI just wanna help others and probably myselfEven thought I probably hate myself  
My dream is to be someone important That’s just because of my egoBut in reality I wanna travel and help around the worldGiving food water medecines and love  
Yes love , I'm talking of lovewanna be rich but be happy and make people happyAnd in this happiness I wich I could find loveYes love , I’m talking about love  
Love is love, like the love of my parentsLike the love of a lover, like the love of a friendNot love for money I promise and assureNot love for money I promise  
I wanna be rich because of fucking capitalismI wanna be rich so I can have all what I needI wanna be rich even if it doesn't mean I'm happyI wanna be rich to give the poor ones a little smile  
And if I'm not I will be poor with a big dream x2Big dream  
  
Love is what makes me strongIt’s what makes me empathize
