My memories are blurry,  
I don't know what went wrong.  
My mind is so unclear,  
I can't tell what's fake or what's real.

I just want it all to end,  
to silence this endless fight,  
to finally understand  
what is truth and what is lie.

My mind is twisted, corrupted inside,  
I don’t want to be like this — I’ve tried.  
I disgust myself, I’m filth, I’m dirt,  
If only the truth could break this curse...

  

I speak in whispers no one hears,

Echoes of a self that disappeared.

Each step pulls me further down,

Into a void where I might drown.

  

  
I scream in silence beneath my skin,

No one sees the fire within.

I smile out of fear, not peace,

A ghost begging for release.

  
(Pre-Chorus)

Where does the hurt begin,

And where does sorrow end?

Who was I

Before I broke and couldn't mend?  
(Chorus)

Shatter the mirror, burn the face,

I can't endure this hollow place.

I want to sleep without a dream,

To breathe without the need to scream.

Is there redemption for someone like me?
