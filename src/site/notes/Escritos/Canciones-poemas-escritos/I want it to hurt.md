I want it to hurt, just for a second,
so I can prove the nerves are still awake.
Let the sting draw a circle on my skin,
a solar flare announcing I am here.

Too much silence makes me fear I vanished.
If nothing aches, did I dissolve in air?
So come, bright spark, brand me with your warning,
remind the bones they carry more than weight.

After the burn I gather what remains:
tiny embers cupped between my palms.
I breathe and they respond, a timid glow
that says surviving counts as being brave.
