I want it to hurt so I remember
that I still belong to skin and breath.
Let the bruise bloom violet under pressure,
let it remind me there is something left.

Pain is a lighthouse in the distance,
its pulse a morse of stay alive.
If I can name it, I can listen,
if I can taste it, I can survive.

So let the ache unspool its tether,
let it sit beside me on the bed.
I want it to hurt until I gather
all the quiet words I never said.

When morning rinses out the hallway
and the wound decides to close,
I'll carry every shard of always
and plant it where the sunlight grows.
