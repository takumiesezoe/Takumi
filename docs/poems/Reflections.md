Deforming reality
Showing us what we wanna see
Everything a fantasy
I need to know who is me 

Living in this false veneer
Nothing here is what it seems
Trapped inside this atmosphere
Can't distinguish truth from dreams

Wandering through realities
In lucid dreams I'm lost between
The light reflects deceitfully
Distorting every scene

Staring at what light reveals
The surface that the world can see
But what's beneath will never heal
Forever hidden, even from me
