I just want someone to notice I feel bad.
I need someone to listen when I feel sad —
a little active listening,
a small bit of genuine attention.

Not to fix me,
not to preach,
just to say,
“I’m here, I see you.”

Maybe someday someone will hear —
not my words,
but the tremor behind them —
and stay a little while.

But everyone’s busy,
everyone’s tired,
so I should just give up
and keep humming in my head.

It’s safer there,
inside the hum,
where no one asks,
and no one runs.
