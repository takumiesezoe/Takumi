fake it until you make it they say,
cause you can't continue victimising yourself.
you insist that you don't consider yourself a victim,
but your sins you said you'll stop, you keep repeating.

you swear this time is different, this time is real,
convince yourself this loop has finally broken
while walking the same path with different shoes,
another cycle dressed as something new.

maybe the making never comes,
maybe the faking is the only truth you'll know.
