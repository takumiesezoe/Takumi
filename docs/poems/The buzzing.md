There is this buzzing sound
that follows me everywhere.
It appears from time to time,
and it’s keeping me insane.

It crawls behind my thoughts,
hums between my ribs,
a quiet parasite of static
feeding on my calm.

Sometimes I think it’s gone,
but thoughts only make it louder.
It waits for me in the biggest rooms,
in moments I try to breathe.

And I wonder—
if it stops,
will I stop too?
Will everything?
