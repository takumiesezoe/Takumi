## Hello, I’m Ezoe.

I’m 20 years old, with a brevet, a C1 level in French, and the Andorran baccalaureate, which I earned with a grade of 8.4.

While I plan to take a tattoo course in the future, my immediate goal is to work and save money. Above all, I see myself as an empathetic and sensitive person.

I aspire to become an artist.

Art, in all its forms—drawing, painting, sculpture, dance, music—has always been my language. Through it, I express my emotions and find balance.

My creative universe is dark, poetic, and expressive. I enjoy crafting works that convey deep emotions, blending both traditional and digital techniques. Joining Brassart would give me the chance to refine my skills, explore new tools, and bring my artistic vision to life with greater freedom.

I have already participated in two exhibitions, one in Andorra and another in Spain. These experiences strengthened my resolve to pursue my artistic path and share my work with a wider audience.

Artistic references: Junji Ito, Yoshitaka Amano, Tim Burton, Zdzisław Beksiński.

Interests: Taekwondo, ballet, alternative music, and introspective writing.
