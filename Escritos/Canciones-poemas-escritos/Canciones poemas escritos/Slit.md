I wanna slit my arms , my belly , my legsI wanna bang my head until it bleedsI wanna jump of the window,even though I surviveJust to feel somethingI wanna cry but I can’t And i don’t know whyI don’t wanna be here I’m waiting next yearTo go probably to the psych wardBut if I go they won’t let me study outsideI wanna go outsideReach my independency At the same time I wanna be close to death He will wake me upTo the real worldMaybe I am fooling myselfBut idkWill I deceive my parents Didn’t study my examTalked to a girl today I don’t know if I helpedI am sleepyI wanna sleep for a long long time Hours,days,weeks,monthsAnd wake up as nothing has happenedIt’s the same stuff every day The same feelingTherapists are tired of meBecause I don’t have more problemsJust slit slit And we can’t talk always about thatI’m not listening in classI can’t concentrateI need more meds, noI don’t need meds
