My scars are fading like the falling leaves in autumn

My mind is crawling , mind crawling into the void

My body shaking but well-dressed in a costume

My inner child crying , while playing with a broken toy

Oh my , oh my , oh me

Always talking about me

A selfish feeling you can see

With Illeness growing like a three x2

If the tree dies , it dies with me

As rain falls the tree grows

As human exist the three falls

That’s how life works , it is indeed

We end ourselves like a walking virus

Taking all that’s around us

We established contract therms

We broke them even postmortem

Oh my , oh my , oh me

Always talking about me

A selfish feeling you can see

With Illeness growing like a three

We are our own euthanasia

Without even knowing it

maybe by the amnesia

I became one of them ,even if just a bit
